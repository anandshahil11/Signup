Hi Anand, 
Look like you sending more than 500 emails without authentication. To avoid spam, mail servers will block  ip’s sending more than 500 emails without authentication. If there is any  proper project requirement , please contact ISE team to whitelist your ips/hosts.

Hi Anand

Sorry, I cannot increase any limits for sending mail via the optusnet SMTP server. It may be something ISE can do? (Not NCS Server team, not theirs)

Nothing wrong with sending emails from odawww01.syd without authenticating against the SMTP server, I used the root admin account – I have just sent you a test message using the standard ‘mail’ utility, and CC’d myself (I received it ok).

Thanks

Regards
Maya
